class States(ABC):
    r"""Base class for states, representing nodes in the DAG of a GFlowNet.

    Each environment needs to define a subclass of `States`. A `States` object
    is a collection of multiple states (nodes of the DAG) that supports batching.
    Generally, if a state is represented with a tensor of shape (*state_shape), a batch
    of states is represented with a `States` object, with the attribute `tensor` of shape
    (*batch_shape, *state_shape). Other representations are possible (e.g., state as a
    string, numpy array, graph, etc.), but these may need additional logic to support
    batching (see `GraphStates` below for an example).

    Two useful subclasses of `States` are provided:
    - `DiscreteStates` for discrete environments, which represents discrete states
      with a tensor of shape (*batch_shape, *state_shape).
    - `GraphStates` for graph-based environments, which represents graphs as a numpy
      object array of shape (*batch_shape,) containing `GeometricData` objects.

    A `batch_shape` property keeps track of the batch dimension. A trajectory can be
    represented by a States object with `batch_shape = (n_states,)`. Multiple trajectories
    can be represented by a States object with `batch_shape = (n_states, n_trajectories)`.

    Because multiple trajectories can have different lengths, batching requires
    appending a dummy state ($sf$) to trajectories that are shorter than the longest
    trajectory. This dummy state should never be processed, and is used to pad the
    batch of states only.

    Attributes:
        tensor: Tensor of shape (*batch_shape, *state_shape) representing a batch of
            states.
        _log_rewards: (Optional) tensor of shape (*batch_shape,) storing the log rewards
            of each state.
        state_shape: Class variable, a tuple defining the shape of a single state.
        s0: Class variable, a tensor of shape (*state_shape,) representing the initial
            state.
        sf: Class variable, a tensor of shape (*state_shape,) representing the sink
            state.
        make_random_states: Class variable, a callable that returns a random state.
            This is used to initialize random states.
