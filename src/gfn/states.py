class States(ABC):
    """Base class for states, seen as nodes of the DAG.

    For each environment, a States subclass is needed. A `States` object
    is a collection of multiple states (nodes of the DAG). A tensor representation
    of the states is required for batching. If a state is represented with a tensor
    of shape (*state_shape), a batch of states is represented with a States object,
    with the attribute `tensor` of shape `(*batch_shape, *state_shape)`. Other
    representations are possible (e.g. state as string, numpy array, graph, etc...),
    but these representations cannot be batched.

    If the environment's action space is discrete (i.e. the environment subclasses
    `DiscreteEnv`), then each `States` object is also endowed with a `forward_masks` and
    `backward_masks` boolean attributes representing which actions are allowed at each
    state. This makes it possible to instantly access the allowed actions at each state,
    without having to call the environment's `validate_actions` method. Put different,
    `validate_actions` for such environments, directly calls the masks. This is handled
    in the DiscreteState subclass.

    A `batch_shape` attribute is also required, to keep track of the batch dimension.
    A trajectory can be represented by a States object with `batch_shape = (n_states,)`.
    Multiple trajectories can be represented by a States object with
    `batch_shape = (n_states, n_trajectories)`.

    Because multiple trajectories can have different lengths, batching requires
    appending a dummy tensor to trajectories that are shorter than the longest
    trajectory. The dummy state is the $s_f$ attribute of the environment
    (e.g. `[-1, ..., -1]`, or `[-inf, ..., -inf]`, etc...). Which is never processed,
    and is used to pad the batch of states only.

    Attributes:
        tensor: Tensor representing a batch of states.
        batch_shape: Sizes of the batch dimensions.
        _log_rewards: Stores the log rewards of each state.
