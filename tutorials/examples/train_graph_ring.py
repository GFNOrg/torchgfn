"""Train a GFlowNet to generate ring graphs.

This example demonstrates training a GFlowNet to generate graphs that are rings - where each vertex
has exactly two neighbors and the edges form a single cycle containing all vertices. The environment
supports both directed and undirected ring generation.

- RingGraphBuilding: Environment for building ring graphs
- RingPolicyModule: GNN-based policy network for predicting actions
- directed_reward/undirected_reward: Reward functions for validating ring structures
