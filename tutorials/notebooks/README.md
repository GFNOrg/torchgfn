Tutorial Notebooks
------------------

These notebooks cover `torchgfn` and `gflownet` basics.

+ `intro_discrete.ipynb` covers gflownet fundamentals and the use of `torchgfn` on a simple discrete environment.
+ `intro_continuous.ipynb` covers gflownet fundamentals and the use of `torchgfn` on a simple continuous environment.
+ `intro_graphs.ipynb` covers the use of `torchgfn` when using graph-based states (in a discrete setting).
